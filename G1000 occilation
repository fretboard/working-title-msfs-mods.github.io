Flying from KDET to KPTK as test in c172-100 using the Working Title G1000. On autopilot and in HDG mode on there is a slight occilation both in pitch and roll, like a metronome set at 40 beats per minute. Weather was turned off and there was no wind and it was faily cool.
Did same thing on TBM with your G3000 and it was steady as a rock.  New to Git Hub, hope this is new.
